    "# Notebook Summary\n",
    "We show you how to use the API to search the Archive for FITS files by **any** field in the FITS headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Archive maintains separate metadata tables for the Primary FITS HDUs (referred to as FitsFiles throughout) and the HDU extensions (referred to as HDUs throughout), and thus there are separate services for each.  When constructing a query, the user should first consider whether the information needed is something that would apply to the entire focal plane of the instrument (and so would want to use the FitsFile services), or whether searching the HDU extensions is needed (requiring use of the HDU services).  In addition, both the FitsFile and HDU tables have sets of \"Core\" and \"Auxiliary\" header fields, where the Core fields are optimized for fast searches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data volume is orders of magnitude smaller, the FitsFile services are considerably faster.  Using only Core fields in a search will also substantially increase speed.  For an example that uses both FitsFile and HDU searches, as well as a mix of Core and Aux fields, see the exposure-map.ipynb notebook in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _find_ service call usesa _limit_ parameter which reduces the amount of output and may speed up the search.  If you don't think you are getting all your results, increase the limit parameter!  The limit defaults to something low to avoid accidentaly running very long searches. "
